## App Concept

Ecolink introduces a unique approach where users can choose between being a "Contributor" or an "Organizer." Contributors actively participate in various environmental initiatives, while Organizers take the lead in planning and executing events for the greater good of the environment.

Additionally, Ecolink enables users to contribute to Kickstarter projects dedicated to environmental causes, fostering a collaborative effort towards a sustainable future.
